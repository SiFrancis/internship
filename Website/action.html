                    <p>After a devastating disease wipes out billions of humans leaving only hordes of flesh-eating
                        monsters and a handful of survivors, you must make decisions and fight to survive. You choose
                        who to side with, you choose who lives and dies, but most importantly, you choose your own fate.
                        In a world filled with hundreds of decisions and hordes of flesh-eating zombies, you must find a
                        way to survive against man and monster. Also, this happens only in the daytime; at night, things
                        tend to get just a tiny bit more freakish.</p>

                        these fractured realms in order to recover the Chaos Gears, meeting other Bayonettas from
                        various timelines along the way.</p>
