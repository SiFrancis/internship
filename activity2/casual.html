                        but with over 100 quests, upgradeable characters, and 20 classes to play with.</p>

                    <p>Treading in the well-worn ground of other chilled, crafting sims like Stardew Valley and No Place
                        Like Home, My Time at Sandrock drops you in the middle of a desert community desperately needing
                        a bit of TLC. It’s a sequel to the hugely successful My Time at Portia, which sold more than 1.7
                        million copies back in 2019. And in a similar vein to Portia, Sandrock is set in a
                        post-apocalyptic period where a disaster has wiped out the majority of human technology.

                    <p>Card games are a great fit for low commitment, easy to pick up and put down experiences. Raven’s
                        a perfect example of this in motion. It’s built around a similar ruleset to the classic
                        trick-taking card game Rook, but with a series of gorgeous, minimalist landscapes that change
                        over the course of the match.

                        Raven is available on the App Store and Google Play Store worldwide.

                    <p>
                        First announced during the 2022 Day of the Devs stream, Naiad is a relaxing adventure where you

                        who need a hand, overcoming light obstacles on your way to reaching the sea.
